# How Businesses Are Breaking Free From Platform Lock-In

Real examples of founders taking back control of their digital presence.

---

## The coffee shop owner

Sarah ran Three Cups Coffee entirely through Instagram DMs and a Google Business page.

Last month, her account got flagged for "suspicious activity" — locked for 5 days. No orders. No way to reach customers. The queue went silent.

**She moved to an owned website this month.**

Three Cups now has her own online ordering system, customer email list, and backup checkout. Instagram is just a feeder now, not the storefront.

## The fitness coach

Marcus built his client base on Twitter threads and a booking platform that took 15% of every session.

When the platform changed their payout structure, his monthly income dropped $800 — overnight.

**He switched to a simple 3-page site with Stripe payments embedded directly.**

Same booking flow. No middleman taking a cut. He keeps every dollar he earns.

## The boutique

Elegance Floral used Square Online for 3 years. Custom templates were limited, their branding was squeezed into someone else's design language, and they couldn't add the client portal customers kept asking for.

**They moved to a custom-built site last quarter.**

Now the brand looks like *their* brand. The client portal exists. The checkout flow works exactly how they need it to work.

```bash
> pattern detected
>> dependency eliminated
>> control restored
```

## What These Have in Common

They stopped renting. They started owning.

The platforms didn't get deleted — they just got demoted. Instagram is now for discovery, not transactions. The booking platform got replaced with direct payments. Square Online got swapped for a site that actually matches their brand.

**Control means:**

- You can't be locked out
- You don't pay unnecessary platform fees
- Your data belongs to you
- Your brand looks like *you*

---

## Built to Last

If you're ready to stop building on rented land, we build systems that actually belong to you.

*Systems over platforms. Ownership over dependency.*
